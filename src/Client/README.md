# my new project

> ðŸŒ³ built with [elm-spa](https://elm-spa.dev)

## dependencies

This project requires the latest LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)  
Then we need some extra tools for localization from [elm-i18n](https://github.com/iosphere/elm-i18n)

```bash
npm install -g elm elm-spa elm-i18n

```

## running locally

```bash
elm-spa server  # starts this app at http:/localhost:1234
```

### other commands

```bash
elm-spa add    # add a new page to the application
elm-spa build  # production build
elm-spa watch  # runs build as you code (without the server)
```
